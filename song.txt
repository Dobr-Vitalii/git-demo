There once was a ship that put to sea
The name of the ship was the Billy of Tea
The winds blew up, her bow dipped down
Oh blow, my bully boys, blow (huh)
Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
One day, when the tonguing is done
We'll take our leave and go
She'd not been two weeks from shore
Da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

Guaya con la mano en la pare' (Tra, tra)
No le hablen de amor en la pare' (Toma)
E' que la baby vino a eso
Dice que enamorarse pa' qué, pa' qué, pa' qué (Prr-prr-prr-prr)
Con la mano en la pare', eh (Tra, tra)
No le hable' de amor en la pare', eh (Toma, yeih-eh)
E' que la baby vino a eso (A eso)
Dice que enamorarse pa' qué, pa' qué, pa' qué (Prr-prr-prr-prr)

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
